Update of Shadowrabbit,金兔子拉面s mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2094933315
with permission.

There is a reworked version of the original by the same author [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2610044320][SR]Bondage Furniture[/url] as well. That mod does not rely on Harmony and is built to have better compatibility with other mods in mind.
